# hls-rs

This program uses the `ffmpeg` CLI to identify content streams & begin
transcoding multiple variants of the stream using the HLS muxer. Then
the program manages a master HLS playlist which can be used to have a
client start the HLS stream.

## DISCLAIMER

This program is *alpha quality.* -- While it mostly works there are
a few things to be aware of:

- This program assumes all distributions belong in the following folder
  structure, and will error if they do not exist:

  - /srv/hls
  - /srv/hls/cdn00_{src,mid,low}

- This program does not clean up the *master playlist* when it is finished
  with a stream. 

- Currently this program starts three separate encoder processes, which share
  no state. A potential area for future optimization would be to split the
  passes into different operations, e.g: scaling, compositing (subtitles), 
  and finally transcoding after the common pipeline is finished.

## Pre-requisites

- a recent build of ffmpeg
- the libx264 and libfdk_aac encoders
- decoders for whatever media you intend to play
- fonts installed if you're using a subtitle file


## Installation

- `cargo build`
- `hls-rs <INPUT> [<SUBTITLE>]`
- OR `hls-rs --help`

## TODO / Wishlist

- Command line flags for controlling bitrates
- Command line flags to skip interactive stream selection
- Command line flag for controlling HLS distribution root
- Need to manage directory structure ourselves
-
